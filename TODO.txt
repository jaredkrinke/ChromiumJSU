Bugs:
Ship shouldn't just jump instantaneously when using touch input (i.e. with non-contiguous mouse move events)

For alpha 2:
Preload images before the game can start
Make it more obvious when the player gets hit

For alpha 3:
Sound
Add keyboard controls?
Knock enemies when hit
Adjust knock based on shields?
Super shield sparkles
Add "don't let enemies through" logic/text?

For beta 1:
Add menus
Complete more levels
Pause button?

For final:
Add touch controls

Consider:
Enemy ammo could "sparkle" by flipping sign on width/height randomly (the original does this)
