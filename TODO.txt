Bugs:
Omnis get all messed up when they collide with the player
Collision offsets shrink too quickly

For alpha 2:
Add power-up pick-up flash (shrinking sparkle)
Add power-up electricity flash on the UI
Add ammo warning flashes
Offsets for enemy ship explosions
Preload images before the game can start
Make it more obvious when the player gets hit

For alpha 3:
Sound
Add keyboard controls?
Knock enemies when hit
Adjust knock based on shields?
Super shield sparkles
Add "don't let enemies through" logic/text?

For beta 1:
Add menus
Complete more levels
Pause button?

For final:
Add touch controls

Consider:
Enemy ammo could "sparkle" by flipping sign on width/height randomly (the original does this)
