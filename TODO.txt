Bugs:
Ship shouldn't just jump instantaneously when using touch input (i.e. with non-contiguous mouse move events)
Omnis sometimes appear off screen

For alpha 3:
Sound
Add keyboard controls?
Super shield sparkles
Add "don't let enemies through" logic/text?

For beta 1:
Add menus
Complete more levels
Pause button?

For final:
Add touch controls

Consider:
Enemy ammo could "sparkle" by flipping sign on width/height randomly (the original does this)
